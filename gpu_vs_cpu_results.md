# ðŸ“Š GPU vs CPU Performance Benchmark

This report summarizes the runtime performance comparisons between native Python code and GPU-accelerated code using Numba for three core computations: matrix multiplication, vector addition, and sum reduction. All tests were run on Google Colab using a T4 GPU.

| Matrix Size | GPU Time (s) | CPU Time (s) |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| 100 x 100   | 0.137        | 0.940        |
| 250 x 250   | 0.150        | 15.903       |
| 500 x 500   | 0.128        | 128.590      |

In summary, the table compares execution times (in seconds) between GPU-accelerated code and native Python code across input sizes of 100, 250, and 500. The GPU code consistently demonstrates faster execution times than native Python code, with values ranging from 0.137 to 0.128 seconds for the GPU code and 0.940 to 128.59 seconds for native Python code.

**Insight:** GPU acceleration shows exponential performance gain as matrix size increases, with up to ~1000x speedup at size 500.

| Vector Size   | GPU Time (s) | CPU Time (s) |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| 1,000,000     | 0.159        | 0.500        |
| 10,000,000    | 0.194        | 3.090        |
| 100,000,000   | 1.041        | 33.417       |

In summary, the table compares execution times (in seconds) between GPU-accelerated code and native Python code across input sizes of 1000000, 10000000, and 100000000. The GPU code consistently demonstrates faster execution times than native Python code, with values ranging from 0.159 to 1.041 seconds for the GPU code and 0.500 to 33.417 seconds for native Python code.

**Insight:** GPU is over 30x faster at the largest scale. This demonstrates efficient parallel processing for element-wise operations.

| List Size     | GPU Time (s) | CPU Time (s) |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| 1,000,000     | 0.159        | 0.500        |
| 10,000,000    | 0.194        | 3.090        |
| 100,000,000   | 1.041        | 33.417       |

**Insight:** Similar to vector addition, sum reduction benefits heavily from GPU's ability to parallelize aggregation operations.
